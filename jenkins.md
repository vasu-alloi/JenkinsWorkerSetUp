Iâ€™m setting up Jenkins agents on EC2.

Instead of manually creating workers, I want to use EC2-Fleet (or Auto Scaling with Spot instances) so Jenkins can dynamically scale nodes.

The Jenkins controller should connect to these EC2 agents via SSH (using the ubuntu user + private key).

Currently, I can manually SSH into the agent from the master, but in Jenkins UI the node shows offline with the error "The selected credentials cannot be found".

So my goal is:

Bring the EC2 agent online in Jenkins (via EC2-Fleet plugin) using SSH authentication with private key.

### Steps:
#### 1.Created an EC2 instance called JenkinsWorkerNodes.

This is the AMI created from WorkerNode Which we have created earlier.

Launch Template:

#### 2.Launched an Auto Scaling Group with all required configurations using a template named JenkinsTemplate.

#### 3.Generated SSH keys to enable secure communication between Jenkins master and worker nodes.
Connect to the JenkinsMainSever name "JenkinsServerAlloi"
```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/jenkins_agent_key
```

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/jenkins_agent_key ubuntu@15.206.153.205

```
The SSH connection between your Jenkins master and agent (worker) node is successfully established using the private key.
this message is from terminal.We are facing issue with only with JenkinsUI.

#### 4.Stored the private SSH key on the Jenkins master node (user: ubuntu) and added the public key to the authorized_keys file of the Jenkins worker node.

#### 5.Facing an error when attempting to establish an SSH connection between the master and worker nodes in Jenkins.

The only Issue with cloud node EC2-Fleet Configuration.
